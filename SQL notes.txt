Table:
Tables are database objects that contain all the data in a database. In tables, 
data is logically organized in a row-and-column format similar to a spreadsheet. Each row represents a unique record, and each column represents a field in the record

Local temporary tables are the tables stored in tempdb. Local temporary tables are temporary tables that are available only to the session that created them. 
These tables are automatically destroyed at the termination of the procedure or session. They are specified with the prefix #, 
for example #table_name and these temp tables can be created with the same name in multiple windows.

create table #table_name  
(  
column_name varchar(20),  
column_no int  
)

Global Temporrary table:

Global temporary tables are also stored in tempdb. Global temporary tables are temporary tables that are available to all sessions and all users. 
They are dropped automatically when the last session using the temporary table has completed. They are specified with the prefix #, for example ##table_name.
